# Child Penalty Explorer: Insights from Germany

This repository hosts a Dash web application for exploring the “child penalty” in Germany—how becoming a parent affects wages, working hours, and employment opportunities for men and women. The findings in this project draw on large-scale empirical data and event-study approaches, with interactive pages that let you delve into overall trends, subgroup analyses, methodology, and a “Build Your Profile” tool to estimate penalties for different demographic characteristics.
